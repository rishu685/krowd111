# 🔧 Netlify "Page Not Found" Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Current Status
- Local build: **WORKING** ✓
- Files generated: **CORRECT** ✓  
- Configuration files: **READY** ✓

## 🚨 Most Likely Issue
The problem is in your **Netlify Dashboard Settings**, not your code.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Check Your Netlify Site Settings

Go to your Netlify dashboard and verify these settings:

#### Build & Deploy Settings:
```
Base directory: client
Build command: npm ci && npm run build  
Publish directory: dist
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Make sure it's `dist` and NOT `client/dist`

### Step 2: Check Build Logs

1. Go to your site dashboard on Netlify
2. Click on "Deploys" tab
3. Click on the latest deploy
4. Check if the build completed successfully
5. Look for any error messages

**Common Issues:**
- Build failing due to dependency errors
- Wrong publish directory
- Missing environment variables

### Step 3: Manual Deployment Test

Try manually deploying to rule out Git integration issues:

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Drag and drop your `client/dist` folder directly
3. If this works, the issue is with your Git build settings

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Netlify:
```
VITE_APP_TITLE=Krowd111
VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
VITE_BACKEND_URL=your_backend_url
```

### Step 5: Force Rebuild

1. Go to Site settings → Build & deploy
2. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
3. This will rebuild from scratch

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option A: If Build Fails in Netlify

Use this simpler build command:
```
npm install && npm run build
```

### Option B: If Still Not Working

Create a new Netlify site:
1. Delete current site
2. Create new site from Git
3. Use exact settings above

### Option C: Manual Upload

1. Zip your `client/dist` folder
2. Go to Netlify
3. Drag and drop the entire folder
4. Your site should work immediately

## 📋 Checklist

- [ ] Base directory is set to `client`
- [ ] Build command is `npm ci && npm run build`
- [ ] Publish directory is `dist` (not `client/dist`)
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Build logs show successful completion
- [ ] Files are generated in `dist/` folder
- [ ] `index.html` exists in the root of published files

## 🚀 Quick Test

Your local preview is working at:
- Local: http://localhost:4173/
- Network: http://192.168.1.4:4173/

If this works locally, the issue is definitely in Netlify configuration.

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If none of the above works:

1. **Share your Netlify build logs** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Check your Netlify site URL** - Make sure you're accessing the right domain
3. **Try a different deployment method** - Manual drag-and-drop vs Git integration

**Most likely fix**: Change publish directory from `client/dist` to just `dist` in Netlify settings.
