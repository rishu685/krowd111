# React, Web3.0 Crowdfunding-Platform (Variant 1)

The next-gen crowdfunding platform. Made with React, Solidity Smart Contracts, and ThirdWeb - This simple crowdfunding application allows users to back projects through the Blockchain and Ethereum.<br>
<br>
The flow is simple. A user connects their MetaMask wallet, then can create a campaign. Campaigns then can be backed by other users, using their wallet and Ethereum.

<p>This site variant brings a sticky navbar, footer, and modern content displays.<br>
